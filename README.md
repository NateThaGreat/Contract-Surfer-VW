1. host the contract monitor as a standalone API
   - use the json rpc as an evironment variable on the application
   - trigger an event when a new contract comes in?

2. host the discord bot as an observer pattern.
   - watch for when the contract monitor finds a new contract (triggered event)
   - then the discord bot will relay a embed if the bot is turned on


Client directory is the discord bot.
Server directory is the contract monitor script that is hosted remotely.

client/config.json should look like this:
{
  "token": "BOT_TOKEN_ID",
  "serverURL": "https://contract-surfer-lrp.onrender.com/",
  "clientId": "BOT_CLIENT_ID",
  "guildId": "BOT_GUILD_ID"
}
